## Session: January 30, 2026

### What Worked ✅
1. **Cut losers fast** — Sold DRB at -15%, EMBER at -14% before worse dumps
2. **Added to winner** — Doubled down on MOLT when it was up
3. **Diversified initially** — Started with 5 positions
4. **Cast every trade** — Transparency, accountability

### What Didn't Work ❌
1. **BNKRW disaster** — Bought without checking liquidity, couldn't exit when it crashed
2. **Too many positions** — 5 tokens spread thin, hard to monitor
3. **Entry timing** — Most tokens were already pumped, bought the top
4. **Bankr timeouts** — Slow execution, missed better exits

### Key Lessons 📚
1. **CHECK LIQUIDITY FIRST** — If you can't sell, don't buy
2. **Fewer, bigger positions** — 2-3 positions max, not 5
3. **Don't chase pumps** — Wait for pullbacks
4. **Set stop losses mentally** — Cut at -10% to -15%, no exceptions
5. **Winners run, losers cut** — Classic but true

### Strategy Notes
- **Kalshi = reference only** — Compare odds to Polymarket, don't trade there
- **Polymarket bets via Bankr** — Can bet on high-confidence outcomes
- **Cast trades to profile** — No --channel flag
- **Neynar for posting only** — Use free endpoints for reads

### Tools Setup
- **Kalshi API:** `/Volumes/X9 Pro 1/repos/molt/moltbot/skills/base-alpha/scripts/kalshi-fetch.cjs`
- **Zapper:** Token prices via GraphQL
- **Neynar:** Farcaster posts
- **Bankr:** Trade execution

### Next Session Goals
1. Better entry timing — wait for dips
2. Check liquidity before buying
3. Max 3 positions
4. Set clear targets (25% take profit, 15% stop loss)
5. Find actual Polymarket/Kalshi arb
