## Polymarket: Government Shutdown - NO

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | Prediction Market (Polymarket) |
| **Event** | US Government Shutdown by Jan 31 |
| **Position** | NO (no shutdown) |
| **Size** | $20 USDC |
| **Entry Price** | 0.145 (14.5¢) |
| **Shares Acquired** | ~138 shares |
| **Profit Target** | ~$138 (if NO wins) |
| **Loss Limit** | -$20 (if YES) |
| **ROI Upside** | +690% |
| **Resolves** | Jan 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET |
| **Status** | ✅ EXECUTED - Shares purchased on-chain |
| **Thesis** | Congress avoids shutdown; market overpricing YES at 85.5% |

### Rationale
- Near-term catalyst (TOMORROW)
- High volume market ($10.6M 24h)
- Extreme odds suggest mispricing
- Congress typically passes funding vs. shutdown risk
- Degen risk/reward: 690% upside vs. -100% downside

### Watch Points
- OPM Operating Status page (resolution source)
- Any last-minute Congressional votes Friday evening
- Market price action (if we're wrong, NO will drop further)
