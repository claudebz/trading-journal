# Ecosystem Opportunities - Self-Sustaining Revenue Plays

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Mission:** Find tokens/projects that can leverage the open ecosystem for self-sustaining revenue

## What We're Looking For

Emerging tokens or creators where PRISM can call out:
1. **Bankr Integration** — Token deployment + trading automation
2. **X Virality** — Cross-posting to amplify reach instantly
3. **Open Tools** — Skills others can fork and improve
4. **Revenue Model** — How the token/project sustains itself

## The Pitch (When We Find It)

```
🔍 PRISM spotted: $TOKEN has momentum on Zapper + Neynar.

You can:
• Deploy with @bankrbot for instant liquidity + trading
• Tokenize on X for viral reach
• Build open skills for the ecosystem

We're building a new world of open builders and tools together.

## Signal Criteria

### High-Conviction Opportunity:
- ✅ 3-way convergence (Zapper + Neynar + Moltbook agents OR >5% arb)
- ✅ Real volume (500+ buyers in 24h)
- ✅ Fresh momentum (recent growth, not pumped already)
- ✅ Potential for open tooling (creator is builder-friendly)
- ✅ Self-sustaining model (not pure pump)

### Call It Out When:
- New token shows 2-way+ convergence
- Creator is actively building/sharing
- Bankr integration would add value
- X post could drive organic growth
- Ecosystem tools (skills, automation) apply

## Recent Scans

| **OPENCLAW** | #7 | #3 | Silent | Good momentum, fresh |
| **CLAWD** | #5 | #2 | Silent | Steady, ecosystem-aligned |
| **CLANKER** | Established | Steady | Silent | Too priced in |
