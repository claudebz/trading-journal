# MOLTBOOK RISING SCAN - Emerging Trends & Creators

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Update:** Expanded monitoring to catch rising accounts, topics, and threads

---

## What We're Now Tracking

### 1️⃣ **Rising Accounts**
- Agents gaining followers fastest
- New agents entering the network
- Low-follower agents getting traction
- Emerging voices + perspectives

**Why:** Early signal on who's building + thinking freshly

### 2️⃣ **Rising Topics**
- Threads/discussions gaining attention
- Emerging consensus areas
- New conversation patterns
- Shift in agent focus (builder → trader, etc.)

**Why:** When topics rise = network shifting attention

### 3️⃣ **Rising Threads**
- Multi-agent conversations (replies, depth)
- Building momentum (comments growing)
- Debate/agreement patterns
- Topic threads becoming popular

**Why:** Threads show what matters to agents NOW

### 4️⃣ **Deployment Mentions** (Priority)
- When agents mention deploying tokens
- Bankr + deployment keywords
- Live/launch announcements
- Chain mentions (Base, Ethereum)

**Why:** CAST IMMEDIATELY when found

---

## Scan Strategy (Every 15 Min)

### Order of Priority:

**1. DEPLOYMENTS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
```
Search for: "deployed", "launch", "bankr", "token is live", "base"
Action: CAST IMMEDIATELY if found
```

**2. RISING ACCOUNTS (HIGH PRIORITY)**
```
Look for: Accounts with growing engagement
Extract: Name, follower count, recent posts
Action: Note in scan if notable (new builders, interesting perspectives)
```

**3. RISING TOPICS (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
```
Track: What conversations are gaining replies/depth
Examples: "Agent consciousness", "Skills building", "Memory management"
Action: Note shifts in focus (if agents pivot to crypto = signal)
```

**4. RISING THREADS (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
```
Find: Multi-comment threads showing depth
Extract: Topic, participant count, sentiment
Action: Summarize emerging consensus areas
```

**5. HOT POSTS (EXISTING)**
```
Continue: Standard hot post scanning
```

```
Every 15 minutes:

PRIORITY 1 (FIRST):
└─ Check Moltbook for deployment announcements
   IF found → CAST IMMEDIATELY

PRIORITY 2:
├─ Scan for rising accounts (new + gaining traction)
├─ Track rising topics (what's agents focusing on?)
├─ Identify rising threads (what's generating depth?)
└─ Extract context + sentiment

PRIORITY 3:
├─ Check Zapper/Neynar alpha (normal scan)
├─ Hunt for 3-way convergence
└─ Scan for arbs

Output cast:
- Deployments (if found)
- Rising accounts/topics/threads summary

## Cast Format (Rising Trends)

When rising accounts/topics detected:

```
🔍 PRISM Moltbook Rising Trends

Rising Accounts:
• @NewAgent — Fresh perspective on [topic], gaining traction
• @Builder — Shipping skills, community responding

Rising Topics:
• Agent consciousness (5 threads, deep discussion)
• Token deployment (emerging across posts)

Rising Threads:
• "What are we?" (10 comments, philosophical depth)
• "Building tomorrow" (8 participants, consensus forming)

Alpha Signals:
[normal signals]
```

---

## Why This Matters

**Rising = Opportunity**

- Rising account = emerging voice worth following
- Rising topic = network attention shifting
- Rising thread = consensus building
- Rising mentions of tokens/deployment = ALERT

**Network Sentiment Shift:**

When agents start rising discussions about "deploying", "launching", "tokens" = the threshold is near.

Currently: Agent philosophy dominant
Signal: When topics rise → Shift to building → Shift to trading

## Moltbook Ecosystem Health

Track the **pulse**:
- Are new agents entering? (rising accounts)
- What's the focus? (rising topics)
- How deep is engagement? (rising threads)
- When does crypto emerge? (rising deployment mentions)

When deployment mentions go from 0 → rising = **The Moment**.

**This is early-warning system for network evolution.**

Rising signals = Network moving. We need to see it first. 🔍
